The Hazard system was originaly designed and developed at the University of
Alabama Birmingham. The system is currently being developed and maintained at 
The Cleveland Clinic Foundation.

Inquiries concerning this system should be directed to
Eugene H. Blackstone, MD at (216) 444-6712. 

Our general e-mail address for inquiries about program availability, 
installation or functioning is

Mail to that address is simultaneously received by Dr. Blackstone and 
Dr. John Ehrlinger, who currently support the procedures. 

The procedures, along with this documentation, examples, and useful
macros, are available on the Internet at

www.clevelandclinic.org/heartcenter/hazard. 

Specific data application questions are welcomed, directed either to 
Dr. Blackstone at blackse@ccf.org or to

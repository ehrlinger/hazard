58         *        Then, for the early phase, we have explored the 3 branches:           ;
59         *              NU>0, M>0                                                       ;

62         *        as seen above by the commented out PARMS statements.  We did this     ;
63         *        with the plotting stuff below all excluded by /*  */ s.  This job,    ;
64         *        then, represents the final output of our explorations.  We chose      ;
65         *        to use STEEPEST QUASI, but the algorithm QUASI would have served      ;
66         *        as well.  These explorations revealed that for NU>0, M>0, M was not   ;
67         *        different from 1 (LL -210.5).  For NU<0, M>0, M also was not different;
68         *        from 1 (LL -210.5), as we might expect, since these branches converge ;
69         *        when M=1.  For NU>0, M<0, NU is tending toward 2 (LL -210.8).  We     ;
70         *        have chosen as the final model NU>0, M=1.                             ;

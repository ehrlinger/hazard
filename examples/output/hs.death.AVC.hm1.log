7          * Another strength of a completely parametric survival analysis is that the    ;
8          * investigator can test the "goodness" of the model.  Specifically, the        ;
9          * theory of mixture distributions would indicate that if a survival curve      ;
10         * (or death density function) is generated for each observation, the mean      ;
11         * of these should be the overall survival curve.  And for any subset of the    ;
12         * data, such a subset mean should well fit the empiric survival curve (unless  ;
13         * a risk factor has not been taken into account).                              ;

15         * The theory of conservation of events also suggests that we can sum the       ;
16         * cumulative hazard for each patient and predict the number of expected        ;
17         * deaths, comparing this with the actual number.  One has to be a bit          ;
18         * careful here, since the cumulative hazard has a limitless upper bound.  One  ;
19         * could make the case for limiting any cumulative hazard estimate greater      ;
20         * than 1.0 to that number.                                                     ;

22         * As a type of internal validation, although the variable is in the model,     ;
23         * we will predict partial and complete AV Canal from the analysis, overlaying  ;
24         * it with the nonparametric life table estimates to check out the model.       ;
25         * Recall that we were concerned that the log-likelihood was better when        ;
26         * COM_IV was present in the constant hazard phase, but we could not obtain     ;
27         * reliable estimates for that factor.  This will help us see how badly we      ;
28         * miss the mark by ignoring this factor in that phase.                         ;

30         * In actual practice, what I do is to have a "setup" job that generates the    ;
31         * curves for each patient in the data set and the cumulative hazard values.    ;
32         * Once stored (often temporarily, for the data set size can be huge), I can    ;
33         * then stratify the data set in every which way to check myself out using a    ;

    <h1>Hazard Function Technology</h1>
    <p>
      Some of the most relevant outcomes of medical procedures, or of the
      life-history of machines, are time-related events.  The "raw data"
      for such events is the time interval between some defined "time zero"
      (t=0) and the occurrence of the event.  The distribution of a
      collection of these time intervals could be viewed as a cumulative 
      distribution table or graph, although commonly the compliment of the
      cumulative distribution is displayed as a so-called survivorship 
      function.  Another way to visualize the intervals would be as a 
      histogram or probability density function; however, because the
      fundamental questions about these intervals relates to some biologic
      or natural phenomenon across time, the more natural domain for study
      is as the rate of occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rate of occurrence of a time-related event is known as the hazard
      function.  John Graunt brought this word from dicing into the arena 
      of time-related events during the 17th century.  It is sometimes 
      called the "force of mortality."  In financial circles, it is the 
      inverse of Mills ratio.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually, all one is dealing with is the distribution of a positive 
      variable, so the methodology embodied in hazard function analysis is 
      applicable to any positively distributed variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nature of living things and real machines is such that lifetimes
      (or other time-related events) often lead to rather simple, low-order
      distributions.  For this reason, we have believed that low-order, 
      parametric characterization of the distribution can be accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parametric approach taken in the hazard procedures developed in
      the early 1980s at the University of Alabama at Birmingham was a
      decompositional approach.  The distribution of intervals is viewed as
      consisting of one or more overlapping "phases" (herein called early, 
      constant, and late) additive in hazard (competing risks).  A generic
      functional form is utilized for the phases that can be simplified 
      into a large number of hierarchically nested forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each phase is scaled by a log-linear function of concomitant
      information. This allows the model to be non-proportional in hazards,
      an assumption often made, but often unrealistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the hazard model has been enriched in 3 ways.  Because the 
      intervals may not be known completely (incomplete, censored data), 
      right censoring, left censoring, and interval censoring has been
      incorporated into the procedure.  Second, the events considered may
      be repeating. This automatically accommodates a wide class of
      time-varying covariables, that class that can be considered to
      change at specific intervals. Third, the event may be weighted on a
      positive scale (such as cost). Thus, the procedure, at its most
      complex, can accommodate time-related repeating cost data, with
      time-varying covariables, and a non-proportional hazard structure.

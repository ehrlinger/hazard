    <h2>The Hazard package</h2>
    <p>
      The Hazard Package is a set of programs for the analysis of hazard 
      functions. Originally developed at the University of Alabama at
      Birmingham, the package is currently being maintained and developed at
      The Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The code is being made available in
      both source code and a small set of pre-compiled packages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hazard package is designed to from run within SAS&reg;. Macros and
      installation instructions are included to integrate the package into 
      your SAS&reg; installation.
    </p>
    <h2>Binary Distributions</h2>
    <p>
      You can download a precompiled version of the Hazard package through
      the following links. The programs included in this package have been
      successfully compiled, linked, and executed on the following 
      platforms:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>IBM AIX</li>
      <li><a href="./hazard.solaris.tar.gz">SUN Solaris</a></li>
      <li><a href="./hazard.win.zip">Microsoft Windows</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To install the binary package simply unpack the distribution file in
      an application parent directory (i.e. /usr/local or c:\). A distribution 
      file will create the following directory structure: (More detailed 
      installation instructions are available in the
      <a href="./installation.html">installation</a> document.)
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>hazard</strong></dt>
      <dd>HAZARD The hazard root</dd>
      <dt><strong>hazard/bin</strong></dt>
      <dd>HAZAPPS The executable directory</dd>
      <dt><strong>hazard/doc</strong></dt>
      <dd>Documentation for the system</dd>
      <dt><strong>hazard/examples</strong></dt>
      <dd>HZEXAMPLES Example programs	</dd>
      <dt><strong>hazard/examples/data </strong></dt>
      <dd>Example data</dd>
      <dt><strong>hazard/examples/output</strong></dt>
      <dd>Results that we got from the example programs.</dd>
      <dt><strong>hazard/examples/sasest</strong></dt>
      <dd>SAS estimate data files</dd>
      <dt><strong>hazard/examples/sasest/ihd</strong></dt>
      <dd>A SAS estimate data file</dd>
      <dt><strong>hazard/macros</strong></dt>
      <dd>MACROS The utility macro directory.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      Then proceed the appropriate 
      <a href="./installation.html">installation instructions</a> for
      <a href="./installation.html#Win_setup">MS Windows</a> or
      <a href="./installation.html#Unix_setup">Unix</a> based platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no way of testing these programs, or constructing specific
      installation instructions, for other systems.  However, we hope
      that these guidelines below help you decide what should be done 
      on your own system.  We would very much appreciate any feedback
      regarding the process you use to install HAZARD. This will enable us
      to provide that information to others, so that their task will
      possibly be easier. We would also welcome contributions of packaged
      executable kits, compiled for different platforms.
    </p>
    <h2>Source Code Distribution</h2>
    <p>
      Our C code has been ported to other systems, and appears to compile 
      and run with no problems.  Nevertheless, even in the world of 'standard'
      C, there may be unexpected incompatibilities between our systems, 
      particularly with regard to mathematical precision and library function
      parameters. If you encounter such problems, please let us know.  We can
      attempt to work around them and make adjustments so that future versions
      will work on yours and similar systems without special effort.
    </p>
    <h4>Requirements</h4>
    <p>
      The HAZARD package is written entirely in ANSI standard C, and uses
      lex and yacc for parsing its input commands.  You must have 
      equivalent compilers installed on your system before attempting to 
      install HAZARD. Fortunately, all are freely available on the Internet, 
      thanks to the GNU project.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You can download GCC, a C / C++ compiler, from 
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">http://gcc.gnu.org/</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have  compiled GCC, you can download the Flex lex program and 
      Bison, the parser compiler.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
	<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/flex">http://www.gnu.org/software/flex</a>
      </dt>
      <dt>
	<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/bison</a>
      </dt>
    </dl>
    <p>
      If you would like to compile the program on the Windows platform, we 
      suggest you use the tools from the Cygwin project, available at 
      <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin</a>. 
      This package includes all the tools required to compile the HAZARD
      system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, download the hazard source distribution file.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="hazard-latest.tar.gz">UNIX gzipped tar file</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now proceed to the 
      <a href="installation.html">installation instructions</a>.

	`Overview of Procedures: Parametric Analysis of Time-Related Events'

	Two SAS-interfaced procedures, PROC HAZARD and PROC HAZPRED, are
	described.  These procedures constitute an analysis system for
 	generalized completely parametric censored-data analysis and display.  
	They utilize the scheme of decomposition of the distribution of times
	to an event (or of any positive variable) into up to 3 overlapping 
	phases of hazard (competing risks), each phase scaled by a parametric
 	function of concomitant variables. The equations and general methods 
	for using the procedures are given in this overview, while details of 
	syntax are given in the subsequent two documents specifying the 
	procedures

hazard.???
	`The HAZARD Procedure'

	PROC HAZARD is a procedure for parametric analysis of time-related 
	events.  However, you may use it to model arbitrary distributions of 
	positive valued variables substituted for the TIME variable name.  A 
	detailed description of the model has been given in the overview 
	document, Parametric Analysis of Time-Related Events:  Procedures.

hazpred.???
	`The HAZPRED Procedure'

	PROC HAZPRED is a procedure for calculation of time-related estimates 
	(predictions) from a parametric equation previously established by 
	PROC HAZARD.
